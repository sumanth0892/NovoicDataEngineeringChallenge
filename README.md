# Novoic data engineering challenge
- How would you deploy this repository on a Kubernetes cluster?

- Assume we now are using this repository as part of a product that we have deployed. How would you ensure that we can stream the data preprocessing? What technologies would you use? 

Finally, please zip your preprocessed dataset and include it in the repo for convenience. Alternatively, feel free to upload it to Google Drive or S3 and share it separately with jack@novoic.com. You are free to pick the output dataset format which you believe to be best suited for downstream applications.
